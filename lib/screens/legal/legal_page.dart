Last Updated: October 27, 2025
Operated by: Ball Street Private Limited
Website: https://fitstreet.in
Email: support@fitstreet.in

1. Overview
Fit Street is a service-based digital platform that provides doorstep personal training, online nutrition consultations, and mental wellness counselling.
We do not sell or ship any physical goods, merchandise, or equipment.
All bookings made through the Fit Street App or Website are treated as service appointments, not product deliveries.

2. Service ‚ÄúDelivery‚Äù Definition
For the purpose of consumer protection and platform compliance, ‚Äúdelivery‚Äù on FitStreet refers to:
‚Ä¢ üè† Doorstep Fitness Sessions: The arrival of a verified trainer at the customer‚Äôs chosen location (home, park, gym, or office) within the scheduled time slot.
‚Ä¢ üíª Online Nutrition or Counselling Sessions: Activation of a secure video or chat session link at the confirmed date and time.
Once the trainer, nutritionist, or counsellor successfully conducts the booked session, the service is considered delivered in full.

3. Service Areas & Availability
‚Ä¢ Doorstep training is currently available 24√ó7 across Delhi NCR, including Delhi, Gurugram, Noida, Faridabad, and Ghaziabad.
‚Ä¢ Online consultations (nutrition & counselling) are available pan-India via the Fit Street App.
‚Ä¢ All services are subject to professional availability and prior booking confirmation.

4. Booking Confirmation & Scheduling
‚Ä¢ After successful payment, you will receive a booking confirmation message and session details through the app, email, or WhatsApp (where applicable).
‚Ä¢ Users may reschedule sessions as per the Cancellation & Rescheduling Policy (generally 12-hour prior notice).
‚Ä¢ FitStreet reserves the right to reassign trainers in case of unavailability, emergencies, or safety concerns.

5. Timelines
‚Ä¢ Doorstep trainers generally reach within ¬±15 minutes of the scheduled slot, depending on traffic and location.
‚Ä¢ Online sessions begin at the exact booked time; users must join on time to receive full session value.
‚Ä¢ Delays caused by users may shorten the session duration without refund.

6. Cancellations, Rescheduling & Non-Delivery
FitStreet defines non-delivery as:
‚Ä¢ Trainer or expert failing to show up within the scheduled time window without rescheduling or prior notice.
‚Ä¢ Platform or technical failure preventing service access.
In such cases, the booking will either be:
‚Ä¢ Rescheduled at no extra charge, or
‚Ä¢ Fully refunded, as per the Refund Policy.
Cancellations by users with less than 12 hours‚Äô notice are subject to session forfeiture.

7. Refunds & Failed Sessions
If a booked service cannot be delivered due to FitStreet‚Äôs internal error or unavailability, users are entitled to:
‚Ä¢ Full refund of the session fee, or
‚Ä¢ Free rescheduling within 7 days.
Refunds are processed via the original payment method and usually reflect within 5‚Äì7 business days, depending on the user‚Äôs bank or payment gateway.

8. No Physical Shipments
FitStreet does not:
‚Ä¢ Ship fitness equipment, supplements, or accessories;
‚Ä¢ Offer courier or logistics services;
‚Ä¢ Charge any shipping or handling fees.
All services are digital or in-person experiences confirmed via the app.

9. Proof of Delivery
FitStreet may collect proof of service delivery in the following forms:
‚Ä¢ GPS attendance verification of trainers.
‚Ä¢ Digital session logs or screenshots for online consultations.
‚Ä¢ User feedback or digital acknowledgment within the app.
This ensures transparency and compliance under the Consumer Protection (E-commerce) Rules, 2020.
